# openconfig.proto

openconfig.proto is a working proposal for an RPC service definition using gRPC
and is still under discussion in the OpenConfig group.  It is subject to change.

Package openconfig defines the gRPC service for interacting with network devices
based on OpenConfig models.

This package and its contents is a *work-in-progress* and subject to change.  It is provided
as an example implementation of the
[OpenConfig RPC reference specification](available at github.com/openconfig/public/tree/master/release/models/rpc)
but also contains some additional capabilities not included in the base
RPC specification.
