# openconfig.proto

Package openconfig defines a gRPC service for interacting with network devices
based on OpenConfig models.

This package and its contents are a *work-in-progress* and subject to change.  It is provided
as an example implementation of the
[OpenConfig RPC reference specification](available at github.com/openconfig/public/tree/master/release/models/rpc)
but also contains some additional capabilities not included in the base
RPC specification.
